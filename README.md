Room Mode Calculator for Rectangular Rooms

## Calculation

Based on the following equation:

##### F = (c/2) * sqrt((p/L)^2 + (q/W)^2 + (r/H)^2)

where:
   F = Mode center frequency
   c = speed of sound
   p = length mode number
   q = width mode number
   r = height mode number

Using the following approximation for the Schroeder frequency:
##### S = 3c/d

where:
   S = Schroeder frequency
   c = speed of sound
   d = the smallest representive dimension of the room
